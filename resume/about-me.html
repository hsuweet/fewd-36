	<h2>About Me</h2>

	<img src="img/vicki-pic.jpg" alt="Vicki Hsu-weet"/>

	<p>As a Bay Area native, this 23-year-old loves spending her free time backpacking in the breathtaking wonders of Yosemite or admiring the coasts of Big Sur. Other times, you may find her hip-hop dancing, wine tasting in Napa at her favorite winery, V. Sattui, or utilizing her bartending license to shake up some delicious drinks for her friends. Vicki enjoys experiencing the marvels of this world and thus has travelled to 21 countries. She still has many places she wants to see and would love recommendations!</p>

	<p>Graduating from UC Berkeley with a focus in Behavioral Economics, Vicki took her interdisciplinary skills into her career as a Product Manager at Cadreon, a subsidiary of IPG Mediabrands. While working with engineers, she was fascinated by how her teammates were building products and was determined to learn to do the same, starting with front-end web development.
